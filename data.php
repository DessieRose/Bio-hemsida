            "As suspicion and grief spread, a teacher (suspended and shamed), a desperate father of one missing child, a troubled cop, and others begin investigating — only to discover the horrifying truth: a reclusive relative named Gladys is behind it all. Through ritualistic witchcraft involving hair, sticks, and personal items, Gladys enchants Alex’s classmates and traps them in a basement to feed on their life force and prolong her own life.",
            "In the climax, Alex — forced into aiding Gladys — finally turns her own spell against her. The children break free, hunt down Gladys en masse, and tear her apart. The missing kids are rescued; though traumatized, some begin to recover.",
            "At its core, “Weapons” transforms an uncanny school-disappearance mystery into a chilling witch-craft horror, using its fragmented, multi-perspective story structure to slowly reveal the real terror hidden beneath suburban normality.",

The tales range from a school principal with a deadly secret, to a group of teenagers encountering a vengeful spirit, to a couple who discovers that one child is far more sinister than they expected, and to a mysterious stranger who enforces Halloween traditions with brutal efficiency. Central to the film is Sam, a pint-sized trick-or-treater in orange pajamas, who silently ensures that Halloween rules are obeyed.",

            "Strange noises echo through empty rooms, shadows move where no one stands, and unseen forces seem to stalk the house. Because the story unfolds strictly through the dog’s senses, the film builds tension through heightened sound, distorted visuals, and instinctual fear rather than dialogue or exposition. As the haunting intensifies, Todd’s health worsens and his behavior grows increasingly unstable, leaving Indy to navigate a world he doesn’t understand while trying desperately to protect the human he loves.",

As panic spreads, the survivors must band together, struggle with distrust, guilt, and grief, and fight to stay alive in a world where no place feels safe anymore.",
